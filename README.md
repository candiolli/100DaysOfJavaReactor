# 10 Weeks of Project Reactor

10 Weeks of Project Reactor is an initiative that consisted of 10 weeks sharing content about Project Reactor on my social media.

Why I'm doing that? To share this challenge I've had in the last few months.

### [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) is a Java Library to Create Efficient Reactive Systems

If you have any questions, ask me on my [Blog](https://silascandiolli.com/about)
